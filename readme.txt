• Overview of what you did (i.e. what are the controls? Why this design?)
this is a simple game where player one attempts to make a rainbow, in any order, and creates different sized rings with different colours
there is feedback given to player 1 to let them know that their rings are being deleted
Player 2's goal is to delete the rings as fast as possible to that Player 1 doesn't complete the ring
when Player 1 clinks "end" and player 2 clicks the red square then they are taken to a new page and the game ends 

• What was challenging.
having the collabritve function work _> where both players click "end" and the red sqaure to take them to a knew page
I got it to work when one of them click it, however when it required both to click it no longer was functional, it took a lot of time to get it to work 
and it's still questionable

• What went well (i.e. how did you solve the above challenges?).
creating the colors and the rainbow went well, changing the colours, sizes, order 
the responsivines , along with the counter was pretty successful
